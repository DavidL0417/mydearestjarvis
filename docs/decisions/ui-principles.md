# UI Principles

## Visual Direction

- Minimal command deck.
- Schedule-first.
- Icon-first.
- Very little visible instructional text.
- Restrained dark neutral palette with a few semantic accents.
- Typography uses IBM Plex Sans for the interface and reserves IBM Plex Mono for true code/technical contexts. Tabular numerals should not make labels feel like a terminal.

## Interaction Rules

- Prefer icons with tooltips for repeated actions.
- Use text labels only where recognition would otherwise suffer.
- Empty/error/auth states must be honest and compact.
- No placeholder data, demo counts, seeded tasks, or fake recommendations.
- Avoid nested cards and marketing-style sections.
- Treat the secretary panel as a transcript plus command line. Avoid filled chat boxes, decorative composer rules, and separators that do not map to a real region change.
- In the right rail, prefer spacing and muted surfaces for local grouping. Reserve strong rules for major region breaks so the panel does not become a stack of equal dividers.

## Layout Rules

- The first screen is the product, not a landing page.
- Main surface: schedule and current operational context.
- Secondary surfaces: command input, task queue, memory/source status, sync state.
- Controls should keep stable dimensions to avoid layout shift.
