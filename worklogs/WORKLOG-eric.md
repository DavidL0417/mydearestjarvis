# Eric Worklog

## Log

### 2026-04-11 14:56 CDT

- Finalized Eric handoff note for the JARVIS backend foundation pass in the canonical worklog.
- Status: backend API scaffolding, shared schemas/types, service stubs, dependency updates, and minimal dashboard wiring are all recorded here for the next session.
- Next step: begin replacing mock dashboard and placeholder route responses with persisted Supabase-backed data flow.

### 2026-04-11 14:52 CDT

- Built JARVIS backend foundation with typed App Router endpoints in `app/api/*`, shared Zod schemas in `schemas/*`, and shared domain types in `types/index.ts`.
- Added future-facing service stubs for Supabase, Claude, and Google Calendar plus `.env.example` and the required SDK dependencies in `package.json`.
- Kept the existing dashboard UI intact and minimally wired `app/page.tsx` to fetch `/api/dashboard`, feeding live data into `WorkspaceSnapshot`, `WhatToDoNow`, and `StatusPanel`.
- Status: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passes and `pnpm build` passes after allowing external font fetch during the build check.
- Next step: replace mocked dashboard data and placeholder POST success responses with real Supabase persistence, AI scheduling, and calendar sync.
