# Cindy Worklog

## Log

### 2026-04-11 23:31 America/Chicago

- Added a visible all-day lane to `components/dashboard/schedule-view.tsx` so DB-backed `allDay` events render above the timed grid instead of disappearing.
- Added a small `All day` badge in `components/dashboard/task-manager.tsx` and threaded the backend `task.allDay` flag through the page mapper.
- Follow-up: also wired raw DB tasks into `ScheduleView` so unscheduled tasks can appear in the calendar layer instead of only in the task panel.
- Status: frontend now surfaces all-day tasks/events without changing the existing dashboard layout.
- Next step: visually confirm a date-only assistant-created task and event both show the new all-day UI after refresh.

### 2026-04-11 19:08 America/Chicago

- Turned `components/dashboard/master-input.tsx` into a first-pass plain-language input flow with local parsing, async submit simulation, keyboard submit behavior, and inline feedback states.
- Kept the card layout/style close to the existing design while adding interpretable command labels for task/replan/edit/remember/forget/unknown flows.
- Status: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passes and the component is ready to be swapped over to a real `/api/assistant/message` call later.
- Next step: when backend routing is ready, replace the local `submitMessage` simulation and `mockParseMessage` helper with the real API integration.

### 2026-04-11 19:00 America/Chicago

- Fixed the duplicated/compressed time-grid layout in `components/dashboard/schedule-view.tsx` for 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day views.
- Removed the accidental nested second time column/grid and standardized the day-view scale to a single 48px-per-hour layout path.
- Status: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passes after the schedule view cleanup.
- Next step: visually confirm the 1/3/7 day tabs in the browser after refreshing the dev server.

### 2026-04-11 18:52 America/Chicago

- Repaired merge/syntax damage in `app/page.tsx` and `components/dashboard/schedule-view.tsx` that was breaking the Next production build.
- Kept the current dashboard UI structure intact while restoring the shared backend data block to valid component scope and reconnecting the schedule view to its existing helper functions.
- Status: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passes again after the cleanup.
- Next step: if needed, rerun `pnpm build` locally after pulling the fix to confirm the production bundle is clean in your own environment.

### 2026-04-11 17:52 America/Chicago

- Investigated a `ScheduleView` hydration mismatch triggered after the latest frontend calendar/store changes.
- Fixed `lib/stores/calendar-store.ts` to use deterministic mock dates for SSR and client hydration instead of `new Date()`-driven initialization.
- Status: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passes after the fix.
- Next step: hard refresh or restart `pnpm dev` if a stale Next overlay still appears in the browser.

### 2026-04-11 00:00 America/Chicago

- Started contributor-specific worklog structure for Cindy.
- Current focus: general and frontend work unless redirected.
- Status: initial log created as the canonical handoff file for Cindy.
- Next step: append new entries here when Cindy begins or completes meaningful work.
