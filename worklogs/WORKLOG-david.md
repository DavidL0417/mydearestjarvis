# David Worklog

## Log

<<<<<<<<< Temporary merge branch 1
=========
### 2026-04-11 13:11 CDT

- Audited the worklog directory after duplicate contributor logs were created with uppercase/underscored filenames.
- Merged duplicate review results into the canonical lowercase worklogs and tightened `AGENTS.md` so future updates must reuse the canonical files in place.
- Status: duplicate worklog copies are being removed and the latest commit is being amended to preserve a single source of truth.
- Next step: continue logging only in `worklogs/WORKLOG-david.md`.

### 2026-04-11 12:50 CDT

- Updated contributor coordination in `AGENTS.md` to define explicit specialization areas for Cindy, Eric, and David.
- Status: frontend, backend/db, and AI/calendar ownership are now clearer for parallel work and handoffs.
- Next step: use these specialization defaults when assigning or documenting follow-up work across the repo.

### 2026-04-11 01:10 CDT

- Reorganized the repo so the Next.js frontend now lives under `frontend/`.
- Moved app code, frontend config, assets, and lockfiles out of the repo root into the new folder.
- Added a thin root `package.json` wrapper so `npm run dev/build/start/lint` still work from the repo root.
- Next step: keep new frontend work under `frontend/` unless the project becomes a multi-app repo with a clearer top-level structure.

### 2026-04-11 00:52 CDT

- Worked on repo workflow instructions and logging structure.
- Current focus: replaced the single shared worklog model with contributor-specific logs plus an integration-only main log.
- Status: `AGENTS.md` now defines the tentative tech stack, contributor identification by name, and the canonical log files for David, Eric, Cindy, and main integration.
- Next step: use this file for David's ongoing work and use `MAIN_UPDATE_LOG.md` only when combined work lands in `main`.

### 2026-04-11 00:00 America/Chicago

- Started contributor-specific worklog structure for David.
- Current focus: general and frontend work unless redirected.
- Status: initial log created as the canonical handoff file for David.
- Next step: append new entries here when David begins or completes meaningful work.
